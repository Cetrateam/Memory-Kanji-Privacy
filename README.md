# Privacy Policy for Memory Kanji App

**Last Updated: April 18, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use our Memory Kanji application ("App").

## Information We Do Not Collect

We want to be clear about our data practices: The Memory Kanji App **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data** from its users. We have specifically designed our App to function entirely locally on your device without the need to collect user information.

We do not collect or store your name, email address, or other contact information. We do not use analytics services to track user behavior. We do not collect device identifiers or location data. We do not use third-party advertising frameworks. We do not require user accounts or registrations. We do not store your game progress or usage statistics on our servers.

## Local Storage

The only data stored by the App is your game progress, settings, and custom kanji selections. This information is stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage mechanisms (UserDefaults) and is not transmitted to us or any third parties.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
